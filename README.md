# Devinenature: MERN Stack Project

Welcome to the Devinenature MERN Stack Project!

This project serves as a comprehensive example to help you learn and set up a MERN stack application. It also provides insights into implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure using Node.js and React.

Devinenature is a full-fledged, custom e-commerce website developed using the MVC architecture with Node.js for the backend and Express as the server framework. The backend leverages Mongoose for database management, while the frontend is built with React. For global state management, Redux is utilized. The application is hosted on Azure Web App.

Key Features:
- Full e-commerce functionality
- MVC architecture for organized code structure
- Node.js and Express for backend
- Mongoose for database interactions
- React for frontend development
- Redux for state management
