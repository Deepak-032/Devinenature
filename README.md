Devinenature MERN Stack Project

This is the sample of the code of my project I have been working upon.
It can help you to learn and setup a MERN stack project, it also gives you the idea of MVC structure while working with Node and React which acts as a view.
For the gobal statement management I have used the redux in actual project but I have not pushed that code here on github, for the frontend I have loaded it with some constant data inside every component just to create the view.
The project is still under development, I will provide the link of the website after it get hosted.

### For any query or collaboration you can reach out to me at dkart032@gmail.com 

### This project is developed using node version 16.15.1
